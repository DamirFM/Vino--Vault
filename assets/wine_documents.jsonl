Rankings aside, the 40-year vines and limestone-rich soil of \u201cLes Mures\u201d (situated immediately next to the Clos des Rocs) produce an undeniably fine wine with persistent minerality marked by notes of lemon confit, and finishing with exceptional length. Elevage is half each in cuve and neutral barrel for one year, and this is a true example of a vin de garde from the estate.", "reviews": [{"author": "Robert Parker's Wine Advocate", "review": "Notes of pear, fresh bread and dried white flowers introduce the 2019 Pouilly-Loch\u00e9 Les M\u00fbres, a medium to full-bodied, fleshy and layered wine with a brighter spine of acidity underpinning its puppy fat, concluding with a saline finish.", "rating": "91"}]}
